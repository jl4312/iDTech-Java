# iDTech Java Programming

This guide will walk you through the basics of Java programming.

## [Lesson 1](https://github.com/RamV13/iDTech-Java/tree/master/Lesson%201)

#### Printing/User Input

In this lesson, you will learn how to write a program that can print a message to the screen, also known as the console.
You will also learn how to read input from the user.

## [Lesson 2](https://github.com/RamV13/iDTech-Java/tree/master/Lesson%202)

#### Variables

In this lesson, you will learn what a variable is, all the different types of variables, and how to use these variables.

## [Lesson 3](https://github.com/RamV13/iDTech-Java/blob/master/Lesson%203)

#### Arithmetic Operators

In this lesson, you will learn the syntax of manipulating numbers using arithmetic operators such as addition.

## [Lesson 4](https://github.com/RamV13/iDTech-Java/blob/master/Lesson%204)

#### Conditionals

In this lesson, using **if statements**, **switch statements**, and **boolean operators**, you will learn how to write programs that exhibit different behavior (i.e. execute different blocks of code and/or change certain variable values) depending on whether some condition is true or false. This introduces real logic to the code.

## Lesson 5

#### Loops

In this lesson, using **for loops** and **while loops**, you will learn how to execute a specific block of code repeatedly for an arbitrary number of iterations. Keep in mind that while the same block of code is running over and over again, the variables being used within this block of code may be changing, thus leading to different behavior on each loop iteration.

## Lesson 6

#### Random Numbers

In this lesson, you will learn how to generate random numbers.

## Lesson 7

#### Arrays

In this lesson, you will learn what arrays are and how to use them. Arrays are often useful when storing data for games.

## Lesson 8

#### Methods

In this lesson, you will learn what methods are and how to use them. Methods are essential for organized code.

## Lesson 9 (optional)

#### Exceptions

In this lesson, you will learn what exceptions are and when they matter. This is marked as optional because Eclipse often takes care of exception handling.

## Lesson 10

#### Object-Oriented Programming

This is by far the most important lesson you will learn in this course. It will explain what object-oriented programming is and why it is so important (especially in Java). In this lesson, you will learn what classes are and how they relate to object-oriented programming.

## Lesson 11

#### Processing

In this lesson, you will learn about the Processing language and how to use it in relation to game development.

## Lesson 12

#### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

In this lesson, you will learn about the core structure of Java's GUI and how to respond to button clicks etc.

## Lesson 13

#### Lists

In this lesson, you will learn about the **List** interface (for your purposes it is a data structure) which can store data, unlike arrays, with a dynamic size. This means that you can add elements onto a list without specifying that the list has a certain length (i.e. a fixed size).
