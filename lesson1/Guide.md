# Printing

Printing is the simplest way of outputting something from your program for you to see. The line of code for printing any message is as follows:
```Java
System.out.println("Your Message");
```

The double quotation marks around `Your Message` identify the characters as text. This is called a `String` which we will discuss in more detail in the following lesson. Without these quotation marks the line of code will not work because `Java` cannot recognize `Your message` as text. Additionally, for those of you familiar with `Javascript`, single quotation marks will not work either. Any text in `Java` must be surrounded by double quotation marks.

Note that every line of Java code should end in a semicolon (`;`) unless it ends in curly braces (i.e. `{` or `}`)
